# ACP

[Cloudentity](https://cloudentity.com/) Authorization Control Plane (ACP) is a cutting edge platform for the API access control. ACP consolidates capabilities of a modern OAuth/OIDC server with an advanced authorization, consent management, and developer enablement.

This chart bootstraps a [ACP](https://github.com/cloudentity/acp-helm-charts/tree/master/charts/acp) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.16+
- Helm 3+

## Get Repo Info

```console
helm repo add acp https://charts.cloudentity.io
helm repo update
```

_See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for command documentation._

## Install Chart

```console
# Helm
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] acp/acp
```

_See [configuration](#configuration) below._

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Chart

```console
# Helm
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

## Upgrading Chart

```console
# Helm
$ helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART] --install
```

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

## Configuration

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). To see all configurable options with detailed comments, visit the chart's [values.yaml](./values.yaml), or run these configuration commands:

```console
$ helm show values acp/acp
```

You may similarly use the above configuration commands on each chart [dependency](#dependencies) to see it's configurations.

### Docker Pull Credentials

ACP defines Pod that uses a Secret to pull an image from a private Docker registry or repository, please refer to the documentation for that mechanism ([Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/))

To manually configure Docker credentials, first createreate a Secret by providing credentials on the command line:

```console
kubectl create secret docker-registry artifactory --docker-server=acp.artifactory.cloudentity.com --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-password>
```

### RBAC Configuration

Roles and RoleBindings resources will be created automatically for `acp` service.

To manually setup RBAC you need to set the parameter `rbac.create=false` and specify the service account to be used for each service by setting the parameters: `serviceAccounts.{{ component }}.create` to `false` and `serviceAccounts.{{ component }}.name` to the name of a pre-existing service account.

> **Tip**: You can refer to the default `*-clusterrole.yaml` and `*-clusterrolebinding.yaml` files in [templates](templates/) to customize your own.

### ConfigMap Files

ACP is configured through [config.yml](...). This file (and any others listed in `configFiles`) will be mounted into the `acp` pod.

### Ingress TLS

If your cluster allows automatic creation/retrieval of TLS certificates (e.g. [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)), please refer to the documentation for that mechanism.

To manually configure TLS, first create/retrieve a key & certificate pair for the address(es) you wish to protect. Then create a TLS secret in the namespace:

```console
kubectl create secret tls acp-server-tls --cert=path/to/tls.cert --key=path/to/tls.key
```

Include the secret's name, along with the desired hostnames, in the alertmanager/server Ingress TLS section of your custom `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
acp:
  ingress:
    ## If true, ACP Ingress will be created
    ##
    enabled: true

    ## ACP Ingress hostnames
    ## Must be provided if Ingress is enabled
    ##
    hosts:
      - acp.domain.com

    ## ACP Ingress TLS configuration
    ## Secrets must be manually created in the namespace
    ##
    tls:
      - secretName: acp-server-tls
        hosts:
          - acp.domain.com
```
