### From 0.14.x, 0.15.3 to 0.16.3

Dependency redis helm chart was replaced by redis-cluster helm chart. The old redis instances will be destroyed in favour of new redis-cluster. Data migration is not supported but could be done manually which is out of the scope of this chart.

### From 0.14.x to 0.15.3

Version 0.15.1 of ACP kube stack helm chart uses `docker.cloudentity.io` as the secret name referencing Cloudentity registry.
If you're using the `artifactory` and haven't overridden `imagePullSecrets` before, you have to create a new secret with the name `docker.cloudentity.io`
See [Docker Pull Credentials](#docker-pull-credentials).

### From 0.15.x to 0.15.3

Due to bug in ACP, redis-cluster implementation was reverted back to redis helm chart. Redis multi-master instances will be destroyed and recreated as master-replica. Data migration is not supported but could be done manually which is out of the scope of this chart.

### From 0.15.0 to 0.15.1 

Version 0.15.1 of ACP kube stack helm chart uses `docker.cloudentity.io` as the secret name referencing Cloudentity registry.
If you're using the `artifactory` and haven't overridden `imagePullSecrets` before, you have to create a new secret with the name `docker.cloudentity.io`
See [Docker Pull Credentials](#docker-pull-credentials).

### From 0.14.x to 0.15.0, 0.15.1, 0.15.2

!Releases 0.15.0, 0.15.1 and 0.15.2 shloud not be used due connectivity issues with redis. ACP might randomly fail to connect to redis. This is resolved in 0.16.3!

Dependency redis helm chart was replaced by redis-cluster helm chart. The old redis instances will be destroyed in favour of new redis-cluster. Data migration is not supported but could be done manually which is out of the scope of this chart.

### From 0.6.x to 0.7.x

Version 1.10.0 of ACP changes the key names in feature flags from camelCase to snake_case [values.yaml](https://github.com/cloudentity/acp-helm-charts/commit/e150d8c713bc1b7eae0f5d272b77071b0c0b29bf#diff-8bff71ce1c243a3af0288410a6f5900e2c5d5bde86fbcbf8124615970237759a).

### Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

## Configuration

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). To see all configurable options with detailed comments:

You may also `helm show values` on this chart's [dependencies](#dependencies) for additional options.

## Work-Arounds for Known Issues
